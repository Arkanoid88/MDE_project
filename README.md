**How to run the crawler**:
- Open search.py and add your github username and password or a token.
- Open dictionaryManager.py and add also here the same credentials.
- Launch the Main, type from the shell python3 'path/to/the/file.py'

**Further Notice**:
- Since the crawler could be very slow, you can stop the main and let the other functions work, then you can launch the main again in order to continue the crawl where you left.
- Inside the dictionaryManager you will find 3 accounts fields, this is just to avoid the abuse control system of github, that is, if one account reached the limit the files get an exception and then remuse with another account.
